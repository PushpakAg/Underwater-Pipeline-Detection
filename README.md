This repo contains python code for detecting pipelines underwater. I have used classical computer vision techniques to get the results. The biggest problem we face in underwater is contrast issues and poor visibilty of things. 

These codes are implemented in reality in driving an AUV. So I had to go with lightweight techniques. We can explore some DL techniques as segmentation using neural nets is quite powerful. We can go with FasterRCNN. 

The codes above mostly try to segment the pipeline underwater and try to fit lines which will guide the AUV. Polylines and HoughLines are mostly used. 
I have pushed all the codes I tried during development so not all are useful, but it contains the necessary files.
